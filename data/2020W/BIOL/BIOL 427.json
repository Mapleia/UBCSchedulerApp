This is the wait-list for BIOL 427-201. Please do not contact course instructors about registration issues, as course registrations/ wait-lists are managed by the program office. Students are moved in chronological order from the wait-list into the course as space becomes available. Timetables may be modified to allow for conflict-free registration. It is the students\u0019 responsibility to check SSC for registration changes. Information on wait-list positioning will not be provided.","subject_code":"BIOL","course_number":"427","section_number":"2W1","building":"To Be Announced","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"10","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Ecology, evolution, behavior, and conservation of birds, amphibians, and reptiles.
