This is the wait-list for BIOL 427-201. Please do not contact course instructors about registration issues, as course registrations/ wait-lists are managed by the program office. Students are moved in chronological order from the wait-list into the course as space becomes available. Timetables may be modified to allow for conflict-free registration. It is the students\u0019 responsibility to check SSC for registration changes. Information on wait-list positioning will not be provided.",
