Course goals are a) to understand the fundamental concepts in ecosystem ecology, their historical development and contemporary application, b) to describe ecological systems in terms of flows of energy, mass, and information, and c) to critically assess evidence-based arguments in ecosystem ecology.  We will read classic papers from terrestrial, aquatic and marine systems, and major topics include succession, nutrient cycling and stability.Location: Bio Div Room 224/Online","subject_code":"BIOL","course_number":"548J","section_number":"201","building":"To Be Announced","room":"","instructors":["PARFREY, LAURA","PARFREY, LAURA(Coordinator)"],"totalRemaining":"6","currentlyRegistered":"14","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"6"}},"credits":"Credits: 1","description":" "}
