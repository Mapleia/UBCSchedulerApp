You will learn version control, the core principles of \"tidy data\", and how to automate and document your workflow from data entry to final result. Students will implement these concepts on their own data using R and Git + Github, and will practice giving feedback on the structure of a peer's project. We will also discuss open science, licences, and statistical biases in scientific research. Students will be evaluated on their ability to apply the concepts learnt during lectures to the development of their own reproducible project.Location: BioSci 4223/Online",
