Oral history is one way of adding to public or community records when there is the desire to do so. This course will consider the theory, methods, and practice for interviewing, organizing, and activating records and the ethics and complexities involved in creating them. Under current circumstances, the uses of internet technology as an alternative method for interviewing will also be a focus. This section is for graduate students only.
