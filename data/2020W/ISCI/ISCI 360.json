Please contact the IntSci department if you would like more info about either ISCI 360 or ISCI 361 (intsci@science.ubc.ca). The course is restricted to Integrated Sciences students. If space becomes available students in faculties other than the Faculty of Science may register in the course. These students should contact the IntSci office directly to be registered in the waitlist.",
