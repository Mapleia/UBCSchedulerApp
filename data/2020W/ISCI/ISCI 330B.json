For scientific, economic and ethical reasons, cell-based, computational, and other non-animal study methods are being increasingly developed and implemented by the biomedical research community. Federal and international regulations and guidelines state that researchers proposing animal-based methods in research must demonstrate that they have considered the methods that can avoid or minimize animal use.This course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in science programs. There are no prerequisites.","subject_code":"ISCI","course_number":"330B","section_number":"201","building":"Leonard S.
