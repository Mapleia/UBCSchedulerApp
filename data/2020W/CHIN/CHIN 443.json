Please only register for the course that you have approval for. To get your placement approval, please go to https://placement.asia.ubc.ca/ - For further information regarding CHIN courses, please go to http://www.chinese.arts.ubc.ca/front.htmIf this course is blocked please sign up for the waitlist section. Students will be placed into the class based off our department priority guidelines. For more information please visit: http://www.asia.ubc.ca/undergraduate/department-wait-lists/ (Is the class blocked even though there are a few seats that are free? This is normal. Please check our website for what this means.)UBC has not yet confirmed an approach for Term 2 courses. The meeting days and times currently displayed reflect the maximum time that students will be expected to meet synchronously with the instructor. Should the decision be made to offer Term 2 courses online, one or more of these times may be dropped or reduced and replaced with asynchronous learning tasks (similar to Term 1 sections). The overall workload of the course will remain unchanged. These details will be updated here as they become available.","subject_code":"CHIN","course_number":"443","section_number":"001","building":"Buchanan","room":"B307","instructors":["CHEN, HSUEH-NI"],"totalRemaining":"3","currentlyRegistered":"27","generalRemaining":"3","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"W01":{"status":"Blocked","section":"CHIN 443 W01","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=CHIN&course=443&section=W01&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Waiting List","term":"2","interval":"","days":" Tue Thu","start":"15:30","end":"17:00","comments":"Registering for this section does not mean you are enrolled in the course, this is a waitlist section.
