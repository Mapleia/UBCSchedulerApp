The meeting days and times currently displayed reflect the maximum time that students will be expected to meet synchronously with the instructor. Should the decision be made to offer Term 2 courses online, one or more of these times may be dropped or reduced and replaced with asynchronous learning tasks (similar to Term 1 sections). The overall workload of the course will remain unchanged. These details will be updated here as they become available.",
