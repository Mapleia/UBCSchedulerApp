What good can historical knowledge, understanding, and thinking do now? Driven by these questions, ACAM 300 is an Asian Canadian history course for our times. We will explore how Asian Canadian histories are portrayed and used in a range of contexts today - from scholarship and textbooks to political apologies and media coverage, from films and museum exhibits to community festivals and family stories. We will consider what role these diverse historical representations play in the present. And we will develop our own ideas about what other histories need to be told about people of Asian descent in northern North America, and explore how and why we might do so. Overall, you can expect to learn about important topics in Asian Ca and ~nadian history; understand why these histories - and how they are told - matter today; build skills related to digital and ethical community-engaged historical work; and, in the process, contribute to histories that can make a difference in our times.Please get in touch with acam.program@ubc.ca if you have any questions regarding the course or registration.","subject_code":"ACAM","course_number":"300","section_number":"001","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["ISHIGURO, LAURA"],"totalRemaining":"1","currentlyRegistered":"49","generalRemaining":"1","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"WL1":{"status":" ","section":"ACAM 300 WL1","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=ACAM&course=300&section=WL1&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Waiting List","term":"1","interval":"","days":" Tue Thu","start":"11:00","end":"12:30","comments":"","subject_code":"ACAM","course_number":"300","section_number":"WL1","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["ISHIGURO, LAURA"],"totalRemaining":"10","currentlyRegistered":"0","generalRemaining":"10","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"The histories, cultures, social dynamics, and life experiences of Asian communities in Canada in the context of global migrations.
