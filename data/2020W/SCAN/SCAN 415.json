      "comments": "An examination of primarily medieval Scandinavian contributions to world literature and culture in light of historical, social, and cultural context. We will concentrate on the Norse sagas. These stories feature elements like magic, witches, zombies, family feuds, monsters, revenge, and slapstick humour. No prior knowledge about Scandinavia or the Viking Age is required. The course will be mostly asynchronous but with opportunities for synchronous interaction, including in group discussions and with student hours with professor and TA.",
