      "comments": "Scandinavian crime writing offers the potential of mirroring contemporary society and is especially effective in highlighting such recognizable themes as global issues, migration problems, environmental concerns, gender roles and the ever-changing developments that define a new Scandinavia inhabited by people from all over the world. Of particular interest is the recent rise in prominence of female writers with women characters in what has been traditionally a very male genre. This online course is a mix of mainly synchronous and some asynchronous classes.",
