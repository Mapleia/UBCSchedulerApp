Unlike other courses which unpack the history or structural causes of these issues, this seminar is centered on how we talk about them. Drawing insight from political and philosophical theorists, students will analyze narratives surrounding contemporary politics in relation to the polarizing debates that consume it. Participants will also relate these topics to non-academic voices to reflect on what literary and artistic representations tell us about societal values and fears. In this way, the primary theme of this course is the dialogue and connection between these various \u0018isms\u0019. Using select case studies of today's contention, this seminar aims to examine rhetoric whils and ~t emphasizing connection in an inclusive discussion about power.If this seminar is so fortunate to reach maximum capacity, please email jyee9@alumni.ubc.ca to express your interest and be added to a waitlist.","subject_code":"ASTU","course_number":"400Y","section_number":"001","building":"Orchard Commons","room":"3072","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"12","currentlyRegistered":"3","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"12"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"For upper-division students in the Faculty of Arts.
