      "comments": "Introduction to Critical Animal Studies (CAS) will explore how the systems of oppression which marginalize humans are intertwined with those that harm nonhuman animals. The literature, research and theoretical frameworks which ground this seminar are those of CAS scholars whose work is rooted in the connection between theory and practice, with an unapologetic emphasis on nonhuman animal liberation from human exploitation. Students in the seminar will choose a topic within CAS which most interests them and lead a lecture and group discussion with their fellow classmates, write reflections on readings, engage in peer review of assignments and write a research paper. Topics covered may include, history of CAS/Animal Liberation Movement, disability, animality, feminism/consent, dependency/do and ~mesecration, cisheteronormativity, commodification/capitalism, media, colonialism, food/veganism, grassroots activism, and their relation to critical animal studies.Please send a statement of intention that addresses your interest and motivation in registering for this course to leahiindigo@gmail.com",
