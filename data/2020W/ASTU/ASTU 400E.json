We\u0019ll analyze fictional and nonfictional narratives about and primarily by neurodivergent people to explore discrepancies between insider and outsider perspectives of the neurodivergent experience with a focus on how neurodivergence interacts with other identities, such as race and gender. No prerequisites except an openness to learning. To apply, send a statement of interest of up to 400 words to kip.m.chow@alumni.ubc.ca describing any knowledge and lived experience of neurodivergence you bring to the seminar and what you hope to gain from taking the course and ~.","subject_code":"ASTU","course_number":"400E","section_number":"001","building":"Irving K Barber Learning Centre","room":"460","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"8","currentlyRegistered":"7","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"8"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"For upper-division students in the Faculty of Arts.
