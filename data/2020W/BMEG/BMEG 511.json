      "comments": "This course is designed for graduate students in Biomedical Engineering and others interested in pathophysiological mechanisms and their measurement and treatment. The course will provide a fundamental and practical introduction to human body homeostasis as well as the main pathophysiologic processes in the human body, emphasizing biomedical engineering and technical approaches. Students will be introduced to innovative thinking in design, development and applications of novel technologies and devices to screen, detect, diagnose, monitor and treat pathological conditions. MEng, MASc, MSc and PhD students with a background in medical, exercise and rehabilitation fields who are interested in monitoring body function and condition in health and disease may also register to the course. Prere and ~quisites: Familiarity with the basics of physiology will be presumed. BMEG students - BMEG 510 or equivalent. Students with other experience should consult with the instructor (Babak Shadgan) in advance.",
