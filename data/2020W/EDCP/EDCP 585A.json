      "comments": "Indigenous Visual Expression as PedagogyThis course explores the pedagogical implications of Indigenous art making and visual expression (everything from mask making, to painting, to performance art), both for Indigenous peoples themselves, and for non-Indigenous viewers and consumers. The story of Indigenous visual expression arcs from before contact through to the present, so we begin with looking at the history of display practices and their impact on our understandings of art and material culture, of representation, misrepresentation, and selfrepresentation (Lonetree, 2012; Ki-Ke-In, 2013) . We will examine art making as auto-pedagogical, in that Indigenous makers learn as they go, about themselves, their own culture, and their relationship with the world (Anthes, 2015; Nicolson, 2013). For the rest of us, Indigenous visua and ~l expression provides a pedagogy as we learn to view art as text, and employ a process of phenomenological inquiry that provokes dialogue leading to better understanding (Leddy, 2014). Throughout the entirety of our examination of this topic, we will be working towards developing decolonial literacies that will support ourselves as teachers as we support our students in their learning.This section will be offered online.",
