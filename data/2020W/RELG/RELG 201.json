We will explore how these texts both reveal and conceal aspects of their cultures and consider the ways in which media (i.e., the material that scribes used) and context (e.g., literary, religious, archaeological, etc.) contribute to our understanding of them. While our main focus will be on what these texts meant to their ancient audiences, we will also reflect on their continued influence in the modern world.","subject_code":"RELG","course_number":"201","section_number":"002","building":"Buchanan","room":"B313","instructors":["SCHNEIDER, THOMAS"],"totalRemaining":"1","currentlyRegistered":"79","generalRemaining":"1","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"WL2":{"status":" ","section":"RELG 201 WL2","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=RELG&course=201&section=WL2&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Waiting List","term":"2","interval":"","days":" Mon Wed Fri","start":"9:00","end":"10:00","comments":"Wait List for RELG 201-002.
