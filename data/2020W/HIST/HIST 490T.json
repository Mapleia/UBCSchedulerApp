In 2020W, the topic for HSIT 490T, 201 is The Early Modern Mediterranean. In this seminar, we will explore the thoughts, beliefs, conditions of existence and life experiences of the women and men who crossed the Mediterranean and lived on its shores.  Our focus will be on the movement, both voluntary and forced, of individuals across the Mediterranean world, and the encounters and entanglements these produced. We will also consider questions of scale and perspective. Should the Mediterranean be studied as a coherent unit or be studied in parts? How do our understand and ~ings of the Mediterranean as a site of historical analysis change when examined from national, religious, gender, and linguistic perspectives, or when approached from the Sea's eastern, western, northern or southern shores? How does our image change when we move from a macro to a micro-historical perspective?","subject_code":"HIST","course_number":"490T","section_number":"201","building":"Buchanan","room":"B312","instructors":["CHRISTOPOULOS, JOHN"],"totalRemaining":"7","currentlyRegistered":"11","generalRemaining":"7","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Selected problems in the theory and practice of historical work.
