You may choose to make your participation entirely asynchronous or as a combination of both synchronous and asynchronous activities.  The class will be divided into three sections for both synchronous (live Zoom discussions) and asynchronous (CLAS and Canvas discussions) activities. The optional synchronous meetings will take place during scheduled class times on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There will be a take-home examination.",
