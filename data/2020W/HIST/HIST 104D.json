      "comments": "In 2020W, the topic for HIST 104D, 201 is Global Migration. This course explores the mass migration of people since 1840. Taking a global perspective, it starts with the rise of industrial and export-oriented economies and continues to contemporary issues of border regulation and refugees. Topics include work, empire, exclusion, forced migration, memory, and multiculturalism.HIST 104D  will involve a mix of synchronous and asynchronous remote teaching, including live tutorials via Zoom on Thursdays or Fridays. Accommodations are not possible for those unable to attend tutorials on a regular basis. Accommodations for the synchronous portion are also not possible.",
