Soccer generates powerful emotions and stories. The course uses soccer as a lens to interpret aspects of the past and present in Latin America. Its interest is in such themes as the relationship between soccer and national imagining, and the role of soccer in constituting various identities, including race, class, and gender, and of local, regional, and national belonging. We focus on the sport's role not only in responding to but also initiating changes in Latin America from the late 19th century to the present. We explore the relationship between soccer and political protest and the development of women's soccer in the face of formidable obstacles.","subject_code":"HIST","course_number":"450A","section_number":"101","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["FRENCH, WILLIAM EARL"],"totalRemaining":"15","currentlyRegistered":"15","generalRemaining":"15","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"A study in depth of one major topic (such as the Cuban Revolution or Peronismo) in the recent history of Latin America."}
