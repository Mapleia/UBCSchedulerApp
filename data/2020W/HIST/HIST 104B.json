      "comments": "In 2020W, the topic for HIST 104B, 101 is Communism and After. Traces the rise, florescence, and failing of Bolshevik state socialism in the 20th century, as well as the experience of \u001cpost-socialist societies\u001d and today\u0019s \u001clater socialist societies\u001d in Asia. The \u001cCommunist moment\u001d world-wide provides a useful comparative context for a global history of the 20th century. Case studies will include the progenitor, the Soviet Union, the largest and longest lasting, the People\u0019s Republic of China, satellite communisms in Eastern Europe, and the unusual cases of Cuba and North Korea. Our focus will be on both geopolitics and local experience. In the end, what does the world\u0019s experience with Communism tell us?",
