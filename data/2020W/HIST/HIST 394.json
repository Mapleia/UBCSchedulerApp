To broaden our perspective, we will consider not only the scientific but also the social, political, economic, religious, and philosophical sources of Darwin's ideas. We will also consider his influence in all these areas. The Darwinian revolution was an historical development of wide-ranging significance. Cross listed with PHIL 364.Please note: during 2020W Term 1, this course (lectures and discussions) will be taught entirely online, and asynchronously (with some synchronous options).",
