We will analyze both primary and secondary sources covering strategy from ancient to modern times, with an emphasis on how strategists used history as a guide in dealing with their own security dilemmas.  As a capstone research course in International Relations, this seminar requires students to conduct a research project culminating in a 5000 word paper.  Please note that this is a reading-intensive seminar course.HIST 403E is a seminar with synchronous 2-hour sessions each Monday, involving student presentations and weekly discussions of assigned readings.",
