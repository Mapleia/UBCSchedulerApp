      "comments": "In 2020W, the topic for HIST 104E, 201 Fascism and Antifascism as Global Movements, 1919-1939. Explore how fascism and anti-fascism became global movements, reflecting on where, why and how they took hold. We will study how Italian and German diplomatic officials, as well as various party officials, tried to influence German and Italians abroad and to mould public opinion about fascism and Nazism.  We will also study the variety of groups who resisted fascism, including the complex role of the USSR and the Comintern. We will evaluate how sports, film and literature became tools in spreading and resisting fascism. Among the specific events that we will examine are the Italo-Ethiopian War, the 1936 Olympics, the Spanish Civil War, the 1937 International Exposition in Paris, and the first y and ~ears of the Second Sino-Japanese War.This course will involve a mix of synchronous and asynchronous remote teaching, including live tutorials on Fridays. The synchronous lectures will also be recorded and posted. Accommodations are possible for those unable to attend during scheduled class times.",
