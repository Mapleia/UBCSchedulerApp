At present, HIST 352 will include a mix of synchronous and asynchronous lectures and tutorials. The instructor commits to the following: 1) Students who aren't able to participate in synchronous sessions due to various issues (connectivity issues, time differences, etc.) will be accommodated. Please contact the course instructor and inform them of your situation. Alternative means of assessment and participation may be possible.2) Since we are dealing with new modes of course delivery, the format of the course and its class sessions remains flexible. The instructor promises to consult students regularly about obstacles they are facing and how we might overcome them. If necessary and possible, changes will be made to ensure the highest quality learning experience.","subject_code":"HIST","course_number":"352","section_number":"101","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["UNWALLA, PHEROZE","TABBAA, SANAD"],"totalRemaining":"3","currentlyRegistered":"69","generalRemaining":"3","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"L01":{"status":" ","section":"HIST 352 L01","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=HIST&course=352&section=L01&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Discussion","term":"1","interval":"","days":" Fri","start":"10:00","end":"11:00","comments":"","subject_code":"HIST","course_number":"352","section_number":"L01","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["UNWALLA, PHEROZE","TABBAA, SANAD"],"totalRemaining":"1","currentlyRegistered":"17","generalRemaining":"1","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"L02":{"status":"Full","section":"HIST 352 L02","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=HIST&course=352&section=L02&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Discussion","term":"1","interval":"","days":" Fri","start":"12:00","end":"13:00","comments":"","subject_code":"HIST","course_number":"352","section_number":"L02","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["UNWALLA, PHEROZE","TABBAA, SANAD"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"18","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"L03":{"status":" ","section":"HIST 352 L03","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=HIST&course=352&section=L03&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Discussion","term":"1","interval":"","days":" Fri","start":"14:00","end":"15:00","comments":"","subject_code":"HIST","course_number":"352","section_number":"L03","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["UNWALLA, PHEROZE","TABBAA, SANAD"],"totalRemaining":"1","currentlyRegistered":"17","generalRemaining":"1","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"L04":{"status":" ","section":"HIST 352 L04","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=HIST&course=352&section=L04&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Discussion","term":"1","interval":"","days":" Fri","start":"15:00","end":"16:00","comments":"","subject_code":"HIST","course_number":"352","section_number":"L04","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["UNWALLA, PHEROZE"],"totalRemaining":"1","currentlyRegistered":"17","generalRemaining":"1","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Politics, culture, society, war, and diplomacy; themes include colonialism, nationalism, and authoritarianism; emphasis on the 20th and 21st centuries."}
