We will explore for this purpose a series of studies, some classic and others more recent, that provide models and illustrate different approaches to writing and thinking about history. Drawing on a variety of materials, from conventional narrative histories to theoretical reflections to sources other than written texts, we will consider history and historical methods as they have been conceived, disseminated, and challenged over time; questions of methodology and interpretation; genre and narrative; and the politics of memory.HIST 333C:  Any student who foresees difficulty attending this course synchronously, because of issues such as a lack of access to high speed internet or being too far outside our time zone, should contact the instructor as soon as possible.",
