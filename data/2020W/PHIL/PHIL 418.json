      "comments": "Arguably no figure is more important for 20th century analytic philosophy than Frege, whose innovations in logic, the philosophy of mathematics, and the philosophy of language, have been nothing short of foundational. This course is dedicated to the study of some of Frege's original works with an eye to how they ended up defining various projects in contemporary philosophy. While Frege's writings are clearly written, they require some technical facility. Familiarity with logic at the level of PHIL 220 should provide sufficient background for an adequate appreciation of his transformative contributions to philosophy.COVID-19 notice: Every student in the course will be required to do all of the readings and attend the meetings remotely via Collaborate Ultra. Online attendance is crucial for success in this course.",
