Most Wednesdays and Fridays will involve synchronous lectures and discussions and sometimes exercises during class time.  Students who are in variant time zones may be assigned to meet with other students in similar time zones and/or sometimes with the TA at times other than during the normal class meeting time to engage in class discussion and exercises.  Participation is not evaluated in this course, though strongly encouraged.",
