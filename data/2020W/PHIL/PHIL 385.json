      "comments": "This course examines the tradition of Existentialism by looking to both its foundations and its innovations. Most well known through Sartre's statement that \"existence precedes essence,\" the existentialist movement flourished during the twentieth century in France with thinkers such as Camus, Beauvoir, and Fanon. It continues to have great relevance today, structuring our every-day discourses about identity, the meaning of life, and interpersonal relationships. By engaging with the German and French traditions, from Hegel through to Irigaray, this course provides a comprehensive introduction to the philosophy of human existence. Course Text: Gordon Marino, Basic Writings of Existentialism, New York: Modern Library, 2004.COVID-19 notice: Synchronous course components include lectures and discussions which will take place from 12:30 - 13:30 during scheduled Tuesday and Thursday classes.
