I will produce a video-recorded lecture for some Wednesdays, but some Wednesdays will be synchronous class discussions, which will be recorded.  All Fridays will involve synchronous discussions and sometimes exercises during class time.  Students who are in variant time zones may be assigned to meet with other students in similar time zones and/or sometimes with the TA at times other than during the normal class meeting time to engage in class discussion and exercises.  Participation is not evaluated in this course, though strongly encouraged.",
