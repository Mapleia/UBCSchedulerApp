      "comments": "Aristotle stated that without friends we would not choose to live, even if we had all other goods. There is a growing body of psychological and neuroscientific evidence that backs this up: we human beings are fundamentally social creatures who need to live near and with each other in order to survive and flourish. This course, which is offered as a core course in Value Theory, will explore a range of key concepts and arguments in moral and political philosophy that relate to the ethical and political implications of being social. The content will be grouped under threemain headings: 1) social rights, 2) social virtues, and 3) social policies.COVID-19 notice: The seminar will include a 1.5 hr weekly synchronous Zoom meeting (Wednesdays 11am - 12.30pm) as well as directed reading, overview videos, student-led group work, and dedicated office hours. The teaching format, where possible, will be adjusted in response to students\u0019 circumstances and needs.",
