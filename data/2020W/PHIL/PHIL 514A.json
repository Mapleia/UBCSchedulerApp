      "comments": "We will devote the entire course to David Hume (1711-76), arguably the most influential philosopher to have written in the English language. We will undertake a careful reading of Hume's \"Treatise,\" covering his epistemology and metaphysics as well as his moral and political philosophy. We will also read Hume's \"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion,\" and the \"Cambridge Companion to Hume.\"COVID-19 notice: If the policies change, I will aim to teach face-to-face but have appropriate technological access for those who cannot attend. Ideally, the class will be held in the time block of Wednesday 2 to 5 PM. If it is entirely virtual, we will still aim for that time, but could adjust if enough students are in disparate time zones. Please inform in advance if the assigned time is a significant impairment.",
