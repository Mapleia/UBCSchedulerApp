We will investigate philosophical issues relevant to virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and robots. Our main focus will be on the question of whether minds, such as our own, are natural mechanisms, equivalent in some respects to computers.COVID-19 notice: the instructor's current plan is for class meetings to use a lecture/discussion format and to take place entirely online. Monday and Friday lectures will be recorded so that students living in distant time zones can view them during daylight hours. Wednesday class meetings will take place in real time on UBC Canvas Collaborate Ultra and will be used for class discussion, assessment (quizzes and exams), and student presentations.",
