      "comments": "We will investigate the history of evolutionary thought, paying particular attention to Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. To broaden our perspective, we will consider not only the scientific but also the social, political, economic, religious, and philosophical sources of Darwin's ideas. We will also consider his influence in all these areas. The Darwinian revolution was an historical development of wide-ranging significance. This course is cross-listed with HIST 394. Students can register in either section.COVID-19 notice: during 2020W Term 1, the course (lectures and discussions) will be taught entirely online, and asynchronously (with some synchronous options).",
