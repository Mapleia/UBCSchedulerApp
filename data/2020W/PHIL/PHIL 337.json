This course will provide a general introduction to ethics issues that are raised by the (non-medical) social and natural sciences. It is organized around three central questions: what counts as \u001cresponsible conduct of research\u001d (RCR)?; who is accountable for the social and environmental impacts of research?; and what role do social values play in scientific practice? This course is intended for students in the social and natural sciences, as well as in Philosophy. It has no prerequisites but if you have taken ISCI 433 you cannot take this course for credit.
