Please note: PHIL 101 and PHIL 102 are independent introductory courses and do not need to be taken in sequential order.COVID-19 notice: The instructor will provide asynchronous lecture material for each reading. Students will be assessed about these materials in the assessment quizzes. Furthermore, once a week there will be a synchronous tutorial session online, which you can either attend or for which you can submit an audio question asynchronously. Attendance at the tutorial OR submission of an audio question count towards your attendance grade. The tutorials are not meant for new lecture material, but for question and answer sessions with the instructor/TAs. This course is designed to accommodate students who cannot attend online meetings. The tutorials, which are online meetings, do not require attendance as they will be recorded and audio questions can be submitted in lieu of attendance. All lecture and ~ materials will be provided so students can access them at their convenience. However, students must have the capability for one online meeting: the final exam interview with the instructor.","subject_code":"PHIL","course_number":"102","section_number":"001","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["LUKITS, STEFAN"],"totalRemaining":"35","currentlyRegistered":"90","generalRemaining":"35","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"002":{"status":"STT","section":"PHIL 102 002","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=PHIL&course=102&section=002&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Lecture","term":"2","interval":"","days":" Mon Wed Fri","start":"12:00","end":"13:00","comments":"Please note: PHIL 101 and PHIL 102 are independent introductory courses and need not be taken in sequential order.Reserved for students in the Coordinated Arts Program's PPE stream","subject_code":"PHIL","course_number":"102","section_number":"002","building":"Irving K Barber Learning Centre","room":"182","instructors":["LUKITS, STEFAN"],"totalRemaining":"","currentlyRegistered":"","generalRemaining":"","restrictedRemaining":""},"003":{"status":"Cancelled","section":"PHIL 102 003","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=PHIL&course=102&section=003&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Lecture","term":"2","interval":"","days":" ","start":"","end":"","comments":"This course has mandatory discussion sections.
