Students will be asked to attend online lectures and discussions on Wednesdays (1:00 - 1:30 PM) and Fridays (1:00 - 1:50 PM) each week. Overview: We live in a society where the rule of law is taken for granted. We think that we should respect the legal system, obey the law, and be punished if we violate any law. But what is law? What makes a law a law and what distinguishes it from other rules such as etiquette? What is the rule of law and why is it valuable? Do we always have an obligation to obey the law? This course aims to explore these issues and demonstrate their relevance to our lives.",

They will be recorded, so that students living in distant time zones can view them during their daylight hours. Friday class meetings will be used for class discussion, assessment (quizzes and exams), and student presentations.",
