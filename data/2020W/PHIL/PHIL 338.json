Overview: We live in a society where the rule of law is taken for granted. We think that we should respect the legal system, obey the law, and be punished if we violate any law. But what is law? What makes a law a law and what distinguishes it from other rules such as etiquette? What is the rule of law and why is it valuable? Do we always have an obligation to obey the law? This course aims to explore these issues and demonstrate their relevance to our lives.","subject_code":"PHIL","course_number":"338","section_number":"001","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["CHAN, IRWIN"],"totalRemaining":"16","currentlyRegistered":"74","generalRemaining":"16","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"002":{"status":" ","section":"PHIL 338 002","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=PHIL&course=338&section=002&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Lecture","term":"2","interval":"","days":" Mon Wed Fri","start":"9:00","end":"10:00","comments":"","subject_code":"PHIL","course_number":"338","section_number":"002","building":"Buchanan","room":"B213","instructors":["BITTNER, THOMAS JACOB"],"totalRemaining":"14","currentlyRegistered":"64","generalRemaining":"14","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Concepts of law, constitution and sovereignty; law and morality; natural law theories and legal positivism; obligation, responsibility, and punishment."}
