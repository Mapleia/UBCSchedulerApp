The discussion commences with Kant, and follows with texts by Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud on alienation, power, and desire. It then moves on to look at writings by Heidegger, Horkheimer and Adorno, Arendt, Fanon, Beauvoir, Butler, and Foucault. Together, we examine the relationships between knowledge, freedom, and progress to better understand the concepts of humanism and enlightenment from continental perspectives.
