Readings will include classic and contemporary sources. We will also consider real life exercises (and abuses) of authority, along with some empirical studies, as sources of philosophical questions and to illustrate philosophical points.COVID-19 notice: during 2020W Term 1, this course (lectures and discussions) will be taught entirely online and asynchronously (with some synchronous options).",
