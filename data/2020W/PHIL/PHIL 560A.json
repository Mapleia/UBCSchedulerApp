      "comments": "The Evolution of Rationality: Does natural selection favour rational or reliable beliefs? We will examine the debate between those who think selection favours rational or reliable belief formation and those who have been skeptical of any such connection. To do this, we'll look at some models of the evolution of the emotions, moral psychology and religious belief, since some argue that these are sources of irrationality. En passant, we'll consider some general issues in philosophy of biology about the strength of natural selection and how evolutionary hypotheses are tested.COVID-19 notice: The course will likely be online and class lecture and discussion will occur synchronously (Mondays, 14:00 - 17:00).",
