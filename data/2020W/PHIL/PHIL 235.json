And do we have certain rights against them? This course aims to provide you with the skills to (i) apply philosophical theories to a wide range of contemporary moral issues; (ii) formulate and defend competing positions on these issues; and (iii) evaluate the broader debate. Beyond this, it hopes to make you a better reader and writer of philosophy in general.COVID-19 notice: Please note that students will be expected to participate in one hour of synchronous instruction per week. All remaining elements of instruction will be asynchronous, except for office hours.",
