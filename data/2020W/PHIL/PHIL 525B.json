Each of our sessions will be guided by a student and focused on discussion of the materials, with me providing additional context as needed based on the questions that arise. If it's just not at all possible for you to attend synchronously, we will try to work something out. Depending on the number of students who enroll, you'll guide discussion either once or twice during the semester. You'll need to be able to attend at least for those sessions.",
