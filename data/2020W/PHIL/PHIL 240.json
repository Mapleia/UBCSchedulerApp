      "comments": "Introduction to Epistemology is a cross-cultural exploration of philosophical issues about the nature of knowledge and evidence (epistemology). Drawing from both contemporary and Classical South Asian sources, we will examine questions such as: What makes knowledge trustworthy? How is knowledge different from mere opinion? What is the relationship between knowledge and action? How can you tell that you're not dreaming as you read this, or that you're not currently in a computer simulation? How do we communicate knowledge to others? Does diversity help a group make better decisions? Course evaluation will be determined by a combination of essays and in-class exercises. Students registered in this section must also register in a discussion section (L01, L02, L04, or L05).COVID-19 notice: We will have synchronous lectures that will be recorded and available on Canvas. You must register for a discussion section, and you will have synchronous peer exercises during these sessions. We will work with individual students who are not able to attend.",
