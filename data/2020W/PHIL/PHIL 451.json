What is consciousness and how is it related to the brain, body, and physical world? Can consciousness be explained in physical terms? Can there be a scientific understanding of consciousness or will consciousness remain forever mysterious? Is there a self or is the self an illusion? Guided by these questions, we will examine consciousness and the sense of self across waking perception, dreaming, and deep sleep, as well as altered states such as lucid dreaming, out-of-body experiences, and near-death experiences. We will also examine meditative states of consciousness and what meditative methods of training attention and awareness can tell us about consciousness and the self.","subject_code":"PHIL","course_number":"451","section_number":"002","building":"Buchanan","room":"A202","instructors":["THOMPSON, EVAN"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"72","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"The nature of the mental and physical; the relation between minds and bodies; the character of psychological explanation."}
