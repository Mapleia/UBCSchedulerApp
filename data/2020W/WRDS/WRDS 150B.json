As instructors introduce key foundational material early in the course, we strongly encourage students to finalize their registration in WRDS 150 by the end of the first week of term at the latest. Please keep in mind that instructors are not obligated to reteach any material that has been missed, so it is recommended that you begin attending at the start of the course (or as early as possible afterwards) to give yourself the best opportunity for success.Instructors are not able to add students directly to their sections.
