To use Proctorio, you are required to have access to a regular computer (Windows/Mac desktop or laptop). You cannot take the exams from mobile devices (e.g., iPhone, iPad, Android device, tablet, etc). You need a working webcam and microphone, and you will need to install both the Google Chrome web browser  and  Proctorio's Chrome extension. Login to the course through canvas.ubc.ca",
