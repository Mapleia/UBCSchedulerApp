A variety of online methods will be used in its teaching. Some but not all of these methods allow students to determine the pace and timing of their own learning. To avoid scheduling conflicts, students should ensure that they are able to login to the course's canvas site during the scheduled class hours. Inability to participate in the course's online requirements can be accommodated only when the university's policy on academic concession (https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/academic-learning-resources/academic-concessions#are-you-eligible-for-an-academic-concession) applies.If this course section is 'blocked' (and is full), it is strongly recommended to register for a different section.
