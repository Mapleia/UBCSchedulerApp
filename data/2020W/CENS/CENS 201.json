      "comments": "In this course students will examine media texts on European crisis periods from WWII to today, while discussing media studies and cultural studies theories of representation. Each unit will focus on one specific media type and introduce students to the essential theory of that medium; however, each topic will be approached comparatively through a combination of media texts. Students will thereby strengthen their critical thinking and visual analysis skills, while developing their media literacy through an engagement with fundamental media studies theory. Units will include the Holocaust  and  Comics, Chernobyl  and  Film/Television, the \"Refugee Crisis\"  and  Photography/Photojournalism, the SÃ¡mi Indigenous People  and  Digital Storytelling, and COVID-19  and  Meme/Internet Culture.",
