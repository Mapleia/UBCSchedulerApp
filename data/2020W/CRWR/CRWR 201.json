This particular course will be asynchronous, meaning you can engage with the material weekly at your own pace, but there is also an opportunity to have a more traditional, real-time classroom experience. Thursday is our high-contact day: you can attend an interactive, virtual class session from 2-3 p.m. PT (a recording will be available afterward), meet with your TA by video or chat during office hours, and share work with your small group, if necessary.",
