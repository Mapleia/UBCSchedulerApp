During these interactive sessions, we will use prompts to improve our technique; discuss broader, contextual issues around writing; and connect to share, support, challenge, and inspire each other. A recording will be available afterward.",

This particular course will use a combination of synchronous (live via Zoom) and asynchronous activities and assignments, though some students may choose/need to remain asynchronous throughout the term. Students will be assessed three ways: 1) students will deliver a 30-minute presentation on an assigned text with a critical eye to the poet\u0019s arguments and aesthetic/political concerns (this will be delivered live for those for whom that is possible and submitted digitally on Canvas otherwise); 2) a poetry diary/notebook that will be submitted to the instructor twice; and 3) participation in low stakes assignments submitted via Canvas and in discussion threads carried out on Canvas.",
