The rich cultures of Brazil, Portugal and other Lusophone countries are incorporated in all materials used in class, providing students with an opportunity to immerse in authentic socio-cultural situations. Students participate in communicative activities that will help them develop listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. PORT 201 further develops the fundamentals learned in PORT 101 and 102. Lessons are focused on slightly more complex grammar structures that enhance the skills acquired.Required text:Clémence de Jouët-Pastré, Anna Klobucka, et al., Ponto de Encontro: Portuguese as a World Language package, 2nd Edition, Pearson Canada, 2013.
