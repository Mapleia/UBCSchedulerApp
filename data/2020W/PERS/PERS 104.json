It introduces formal speech styles, reinforces grammatical accuracy, and improves reading and writing competencies.  Restricted to Persian heritage* students or students born in Iran and who have studied in Iran up to (but not beyond) grade 2 before coming to Canada.  *Heritage students are those with a certain level of oral and/or aural proficiency in Persian because they were raised in a home outside Iran where Persian was spoken.  They have little or no knowledge of or training in reading and writing Persian.To secure a place in a Persian language course, attendance in all class meetings is mandatory during the first week of classes. Students with unexcused absences will be dropped from the course.
