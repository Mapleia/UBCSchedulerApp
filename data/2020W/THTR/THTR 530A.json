While our readings draw from an interdisciplinary scholarly literature in the humanities, our analysis and discussion will focus on theatre, live art and film as our primary artistic media. To that end, the readings also include plays and students will be asked to screen course-related films outside our scheduled class time. As the course will also coincide with a number of 2017 UBC and Vancouver disability arts and cultural events, students will also be encouraged to attend some of these.",
