The academic records of all students who register into the course will be checked and those not having an appropriate academic background for their designated specialization will be de-registered. Additionally, registration in co-requisite courses (Bioc 302 or Bioc 303) will be checked and any students not registered in the appropriate course may be removed from Bioc 301.No preference is given to 4th year students and, accordingly, direct registration is restricted to students with 3rd year standing in the Faculty of Science.  Eligible 4th year students needing to take the course should register into the wait-list section and contact the Biochemistry adviser (jaread@mail.ubc.ca) to request entry to the course.  Approved 4th year students will be registered by the department when their academic standing matches that of the incoming 3rd year class.",
