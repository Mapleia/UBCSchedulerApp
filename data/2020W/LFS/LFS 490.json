This student directed seminar (taught by Allison Gacad, Bachelor of Science in Global Resource Systems, LFS) will assess the role of crop production technology in the global food system. Using a systems-thinking approach, participants will assess the social, economic, and ecological impacts of such technology (potential examples include, but are not limited to, hydroponics, artificial intelligence, biofertilizer, and genome editing). Participants will also have an opportunity to design technological interventions that can be used to build global sustainable food systems within existing political, social, economic, and ecological structures and systems.","subject_code":"LFS","course_number":"490","section_number":"001","building":"Orchard Commons","room":"3068","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"6","currentlyRegistered":"9","generalRemaining":"3","restrictedRemaining":"3"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Analysis and interpretation of current issues related to land and food systems."}
