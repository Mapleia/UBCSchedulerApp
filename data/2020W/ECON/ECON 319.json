We will trace the development of economics from circa 1800 up to the present, focusing on the conceptual and methodological foundations of economics, and on the problems of value and distribution. We will read David Ricardo, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill, William Stanley Jevons, John Maynard Keynes, Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Amartya Sen.
