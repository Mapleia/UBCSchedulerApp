The remaining 30 seats are open to all UBC students.This course proposes the history of Early Modern through Postmodern art as the history of paradigm shifts in the technological mediation of the phenomenal world. We explore single-point perspective, often understood to be the crowning achievement of Western illusionistic pictorial representation, as it developed in relationship to mathematics and architecture. We then move through the heliocentric revolution that undergirds the Early Modern period and new technologies of social organization that found the institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. Finally, we explore the discourse of and relationship between medium and media that informs visual cognition in the 20th century.","subject_code":"ARTH","course_number":"380","section_number":"001","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"2","currentlyRegistered":"58","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"2"},"L01":{"status":"Full","section":"ARTH 380 L01","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=ARTH&course=380&section=L01&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Tutorial","term":"1","interval":"","days":" Tue","start":"18:00","end":"19:00","comments":"","subject_code":"ARTH","course_number":"380","section_number":"L01","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"15","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"L02":{"status":" ","section":"ARTH 380 L02","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=ARTH&course=380&section=L02&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Tutorial","term":"1","interval":"","days":" Tue","start":"19:00","end":"20:00","comments":"","subject_code":"ARTH","course_number":"380","section_number":"L02","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"1","currentlyRegistered":"14","generalRemaining":"1","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"L03":{"status":" ","section":"ARTH 380 L03","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=ARTH&course=380&section=L03&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Tutorial","term":"1","interval":"","days":" Thu","start":"12:00","end":"13:00","comments":"","subject_code":"ARTH","course_number":"380","section_number":"L03","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"2","currentlyRegistered":"13","generalRemaining":"2","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"L04":{"status":"Full","section":"ARTH 380 L04","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=ARTH&course=380&section=L04&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Tutorial","term":"1","interval":"","days":" Thu","start":"13:00","end":"14:00","comments":"","subject_code":"ARTH","course_number":"380","section_number":"L04","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"16","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"01W":{"status":" ","section":"ARTH 380 01W","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=ARTH&course=380&section=01W&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Waiting List","term":"1","interval":"","days":" Mon","start":"9:00","end":"11:00","comments":"ARTH 380 01W is a waitlist for ARTH 380 001.
