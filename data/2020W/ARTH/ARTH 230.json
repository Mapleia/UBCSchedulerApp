If the course is blocked, the class is full and you should register in the associated waitlist, ARTH 230 01W. Students will be moved from the waitlist into the class as seats become available, and notified of their registration via email.What constitutes a \"feminist\" art practice in the present day, and to whom do we owe feminist art historical genealogies? This course examines the diverse strands of artistic and cultural production from the 19th century to the present day that contribute to histories of feminist art. The early 1970s marks the era in North America when \"feminist art\" came into view as a category, while in the decades following, artists have worked to take into account global developments in art, activism, and theory that have pluralized feminist identifications and have explored intersections with race, ethnicity, ability, gender, class, and sexual orientation, with important developments, in the 21st century, toward trans-inclusive theory and practice.",
