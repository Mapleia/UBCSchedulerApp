Students will be moved from the wait list into the lecture as spaces become available, and then notified of their registration via email.Selected case studies will explore key themes and debates associated with art, architecture and material culture in a range of world regions and communities. The purpose of the course is not to attempt a survey of world art. Rather, the goal is examine the ways in which a range of historical factors -- issues of gender and social hierarchy, economic and religious transformations; changing social and political institutions; imperial and colonial expansion; the emergence of new technologies, and shifting definitions of patrons and viewing publics -- have shaped imagery, objects, buildings and monuments, as well as those who view and use them.",
