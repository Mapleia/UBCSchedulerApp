If the course is blocked, the class is full and you should register in the associated waitlist, ARTH 225 01W. Students will be moved from the waitlist into the class as seats become available, and notified of their registration via email.What does it mean to study art and architecture in Europe, but before Europe? In simple terms, it means discussing works of art and architecture from a geography that roughly corresponds to the extended boundaries of today's European Union and its immediate environs, but during a period when there was no unified or unifying idea of Europe. In more complex terms, it means approaching artistic and architectural products from the same region with no reference to the notion of a homogeneous Europe, with no reference to a European idea or ideal, and therefore without making the very recent concept of Europe the centre of our analytical lenses. In other words, it means not being Eurocentric when discussing art and architecture from Europe.",
