The social and cultural transformations of this distant era have always played a crucial role in the historical memories of Europe, North Africa, the Near East, and the Americas. We will investigate how cities, monuments, houses, religious spaces, and artifacts echoed and contributed to the cultural diversity of this period. A wide geographical and social focus will help us to study the distinctive characteristics of the post-classical world, including the survival of Greek and Roman visual traditions, the emergence of the Byzantine civilization, the co-existence of various faiths and practices across the Mediterranean, and the social mobility of people.","subject_code":"ARTH","course_number":"310","section_number":"001","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["MAKRIS, GEORGIOS"],"totalRemaining":"3","currentlyRegistered":"47","generalRemaining":"3","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Visual culture and the rise of Christianity; social, political and religious contexts of art, including diverse viewing practices and cultural frameworks.
