If registration for the course is blocked, it is full and the waitlist ARTH 363 01W has been opened.This class revisits some of the main sites of the history of painting in Japan, introducing their formal aspects as well as examining some of the current debates they have served to ground. The subject of this course is thus both the objects comprised in the modern category \"Japanese painting\" and the category \"Japanese painting\" itself. The structure of the course is diachronic and thematic. Issues examined include influence, narrative, style, verisimilitude, and modernity/modernism.",
