MSN students interested in registering, please enrol in the waitlist section NURS 531-02W, and you will be contacted by School of Nursing Student Support Office (academic.support@nursing.ubc.ca) when space is available in the course.This course will introduce theories of learning and their application to clinical education. You will gain knowledge of different domains of knowledge relevant to clinical practice and identify strategies to foster learning in different domains. You will be challenged to critically analyze the implications of the \u001ctheory-practice\u001d gaps and develop a repertoire of strategies to apply theory in a range of simple to complex clinical educational contexts. Finally, you will analyze approaches to clinical education in formative education and professional development contexts and be challenged to employ different \u001cknowledge to action strategies\u001d to link theoretical foundations of clinical education with learning approaches.",
