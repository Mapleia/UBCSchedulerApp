You will gain knowledge of different domains of knowledge relevant to clinical practice and identify strategies to foster learning in different domains. You will be challenged to critically analyze the implications of the \u001ctheory-practice\u001d gaps and develop a repertoire of strategies to apply theory in a range of simple to complex clinical educational contexts. Finally, you will analyze approaches to clinical education in formative education and professional development contexts and be challenged to employ different \u001cknowledge to action strategies\u001d to link theoretical foundations of clinical education with learning approaches.","subject_code":"NURS","course_number":"531","section_number":"002","building":"School of Population and Public Health","room":"B108","instructors":["WYTENBROEK, LYDIA"],"totalRemaining":"28","currentlyRegistered":"2","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"28"},"02W":{"status":" ","section":"NURS 531 02W","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=NURS&course=531&section=02W&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Waiting List","term":"2","interval":"","days":" ","start":" ","end":" ","comments":"waitlist for NURS 531-002","subject_code":"NURS","course_number":"531","section_number":"02W","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"21","currentlyRegistered":"9","generalRemaining":"21","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Theories of learning and their implications for the design of clinical learning experiences."}
