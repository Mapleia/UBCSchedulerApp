Point of departure forms the correspondence of Charlotte Schiller (née von Lengefeld, 1766-1826), wife to one of Germany most renowned poets, Friedrich Schiller (1759-1805). Course Readings include firstly, selected letters in manuscript and edited forms; and secondly, epistolary novels/novellas by Sophie von La Roche (\"Geschichte des Fräuleins von Sternheim\", 1771), Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (\"Die Leiden des jungen Werthers\", 1774), and Charlotte Schiller (\"Rosalie\", 1800) - referring ba and ~ck to French and English texts by Richardson and Diderot. In the final section, we'll read two dramatic texts, Friederike Sophie Hensel's \"Die Familie auf dem Lande / Die Entführung\" (1770/1772), which transforms an epistolary novel by Frances Sheridan into a bourgeois tragedy, and Friedrich Schiller's historical drama about state violence and censorship, \"Don Carlos\"(1787).",
