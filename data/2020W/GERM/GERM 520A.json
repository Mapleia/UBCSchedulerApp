It focuses on narratives of migration from an interdisciplinary studies point of view. While one part of the course will utilize Social Studies concepts of postmigration, super-diversity and plurality for an analysis of literary narratives as counter-narratives to Eurocentric, ethnically and nationally centred models of belonging, another part will investigate contemporary German-language authors who write about flight, immigration and refuge. How do their narratives perform hybrid and plural identities that go across borders, including the dealing with memories of colonial history, genocides and wars?","subject_code":"GERM","course_number":"520A","section_number":"001","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["HALLENSLEBEN, MARKUS"],"totalRemaining":"6","currentlyRegistered":"2","generalRemaining":"6","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":" "}
