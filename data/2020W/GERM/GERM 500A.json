Looking at the memory culture that has emerged around East Germany since 1989, students will explore a selection of sites and practices of memory and memory-making. Topics will include narratives of remembering (literature, film, television, and comics), the physical spaces of memory (memorials and museums), and the objects of memory (furniture, fashion, and food culture). Primary texts will be supplemented with interdisciplinary secondary literature to foster students\u0019 critical engagement with East German memory culture(s) and include theory from memory studies, museum studies, cultural studies, comics  and ~studies, visual culture studies, and film and media studies. Lastly, this course will integrate practical instruction on graduate studies to support students in developing the strategies they will need to succeed in graduate school, while practicing the various genres of academic writing essential to our field.","subject_code":"GERM","course_number":"500A","section_number":"001","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["NIJDAM, ELIZABETH"],"totalRemaining":"4","currentlyRegistered":"3","generalRemaining":"4","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":" "}
