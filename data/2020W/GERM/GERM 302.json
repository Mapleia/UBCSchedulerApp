We will critically discuss topics such as diasporic and national belonging, asylum and integration politics, multiculturality and European cultural identity. All readings are in translation and focus on contemporary transnational German-language literature and film affected by migration. While the beginning of the course covers Jewish and political exile during National Socialism, the other parts deal with Germany as an immigration country since the fall of the wall in 1989, including its \"Welcome Culture\" as response to the global \"refugee crisis\" in 2015. Only Tuesday lessons will be synchronous.",
