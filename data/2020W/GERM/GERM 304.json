We will watch some of the most iconic along lesser known, yet impactful films from the period. The goal of the course is to examine the formation of the German star system, film fandom cultures, and cinema exhibition practices as these relate to questions of gender, sex, desire, and sexuality.",

From the futuristic skyline of Metropolis to the post-WWII ruins in Zentropa, urban filmscapes have largely contributed to the shaping and reshaping of German culture. This course proposes a trajectory through German and international film history and the urban imaginary. Our objectives will be twofold: first, we will follow the motif of the \"reel city,\" distinguishing among its various configurations; and secondly, we will develop a theoretical framework for film analysis and interpretation. Lectures and discussions will be in English. This course will be taught asynchronously online.",
