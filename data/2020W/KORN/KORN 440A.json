For more information please visit: http://www.asia.ubc.ca/undergraduate/department-wait-lists/ (Is the class blocked even though there are a few seats that are free? This is normal. Please check our website for what this means.)UBC has not yet confirmed an approach for Term 2 courses. The meeting days and times currently displayed reflect the maximum time that students will be expected to meet synchronously with the instructor. Should the decision be made to offer Term 2 courses online, one or more of these times may be dropped or reduced, and replaced with asynchronous learning tasks. These details will be updated here as they become available. The overall workload of the course will remain unchanged.",
