The world of international development faces many challenges, one of which is the failure of assistance interventions (aid projects and programmes). Students will develop a practical understanding of the logical processes by which projects are designed and implemented, including the need for external evaluation in order to assess the efficacy, outcomes, and sustainability of these interventions. Lack of project success, more often than not, is a result of inadequate impact evaluation strategies. Students will learn skills to develop strong monitoring  and  evaluation plans in order to overcome these deficiencies.\u001dThere are two sections of FRE and ~ 490 to accommodate for students in different time zones: students will have the same experience in both section 001 (@11:00am Vancouver time) and 002 (@8:00pm Vancouver time): register in the section that best fits your schedule and time zone.",
