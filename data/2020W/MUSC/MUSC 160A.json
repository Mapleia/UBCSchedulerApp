The course focuses on small ensemble combinations (trios, quartets, etc.) which will be formed in September. A regular coaching time will then be assigned to each small ensemble during the indicated hours. Each ensemble should also schedule regular rehearsal time(s) during these hours. Please note that University Chamber Strings (MUSC 159A 001) will be coordinated with small ensemble activity in MUSC 160, for one 4-week intensive period in each term. Students registering in both MUSC 159A and 160A will need to contact the Music Advisor (music.advisor@ubc.ca) for a registration override. Students seeking additional small ensemble credit may also register in MUSC 157A 001 (Early Music Ensemble) or MUSC 163 001 (Contemporary Pla and ~yers).OPEN TO NON-MUSIC STUDENTS: How do I register for ensembles?  For most ensembles an audition is required to secure your place. During the audition you play or sing a prepared piece for the conductor. Auditions for ensembles take place at the beginning of each academic year. Additional information regarding auditions, including downloadable excerpts for each instrument/voice, can be found here: http://www.music.ubc.ca/student-ensembles.html.
