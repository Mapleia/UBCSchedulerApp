Each ensemble should also schedule regular rehearal time(s) during these hours.  Students registered in MUSC 161 who also wish to register in MUSC 157 (Early Music Ensembles) or MUSC 163 (Contemporary Players) may do so, but will need to contact the Music Advisor (music.advisor@ubc.ca) for a registration override.  Students needing additional chamber ensemble credit may be able to register for additional credit in September, pending approval from the Division.BMUS General Music students with a concentration in Piano may apply to enroll in MUSC 161A upon completion of MUSC 167 with a minimum grade of 88.  Approval from the instructor of MUSC 167 and permission from solo piano instructor are also required. Final permission to enroll is not guaranteed, and will be given by the Chamber Music Coordinator (in consultation with the Director, as needed).

General Music piano concentrators allowed to register in MUSC 161 will normally be permitted to take it only once, for 2 credits. They may apply to take MUSC 161 a second time if they have obtained a minimum grade of 88 in the course.",
