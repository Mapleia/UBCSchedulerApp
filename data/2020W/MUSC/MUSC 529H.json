Historical concerns, terminology, and pivotal figures in the field will also be examined in some detail. Seminars will include structured listening and viewing to enhance your understanding of attitudes held toward music making, and the social and political base of such activity from a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary perspective. Research projects will further hone your bibliographic and critical thinking skills. By taking this course I hope you will acquire the requisite background knowledge and conceptual tools to approach all of the world\u0019s music from a curious, respectful, and yet critical vantage point.2020W Format: Students attend an online seminar every Wednesday from 10 am to noon.",
