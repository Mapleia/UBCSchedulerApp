      "comments": "Tonal Analysis.  With Music 411. This course focuses on sonata form around the turn of the nineteenth century, with a special focus on works by Schubert. The analytical approach encompasses techniques that complement Schenkerian analysis. Topics include chromaticism and enharmonicism, harmonic rhythm and phrase rhythm, and divergences from Classical-era formal norms. There is no textbook, but several advanced readings will be assigned. This course is open to anyone who has successfully completed the Graduate Entrance Examination in theory.",
