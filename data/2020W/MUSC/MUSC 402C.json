Interested students will need to submit to Dr. Dodson (alan.dodson(at)ubc.ca; Rm. 423 MUSC building), a written proposal -- outlining what work will be done, how it will be evaluated, and signed by the supervising FT faculty member. MUSC 402 should be in a music-related subject that a full-time Music faculty member can supervise.  402s have to be approved by the Undergraduate Committee Chair (Dr. Alan Dodson - alan.dodson(at)ubc.ca or 604-822-5287).  Develop a written proposal as follows: Brainstorm topics; talk to some professors (not part-time faculty), see who's interested and available to supervise you.Write a proposal that:* describes the topic* describes the type and quantity of work you will do (typically each week you'll do 4-5 hours of independent research, then meet for an hour with the supervisor; and at the end you'll produce a substantial paper.  Think about the course as if it is an upper-level history course, with classtime and research papers.)* specifies the number of credits (3 for one term, 6 for the full year, which would obviously require twice the work)* describes how your work will be evaluated (graded)* names the supervisor, and explains what kind of supervision s/he will provideGet the supervisor to sign the proposal so that I know s/he is willing to work with you, and that s/he agrees to evaluate you as the proposal states.","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"402C","section_number":"003","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"0","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"004":{"status":"Unreleased","section":"MUSC 402C 004","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=MUSC&course=402C&section=004&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Directed Studies","term":"1-2","interval":"","days":" ","start":" ","end":" ","comments":"","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"402C","section_number":"004","building":"No Scheduled Meeting","room":"","instructors":["TBA"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"0","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 6","description":"For fourth-year students who receive permission of the Director of the School of Music to do advanced studies in their major field."}
