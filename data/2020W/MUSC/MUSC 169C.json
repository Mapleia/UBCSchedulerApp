Permission to take 169 must come from the division coordinator (via a signed drop/add form forwarded to the MUSC student advisor) who will coach you in either 160 or 162, because 169  has 160 or 162 as a co-requisite (as 169 represents \"extra work\" you are doing in 160 or 162).  Not for use by pianists.  Hand in course add form to Music Student Advisor (music.advisor@ubc.ca)",
