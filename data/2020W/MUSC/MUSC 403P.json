This course explores the dissemination, performance, and consumption of Western Art Music across the world in the long nineteenth century. What happens when European art music migrates across the globe? Who brought and consumed European music outside Europe? What institutions facilitated the global consumption of European music? How did these patterns of dissemination shape processes of encounter between European and non-European peoples? How did they contribute to forms of cultural hybridity? How did they participate to colonial and hegemonic practices? This seminar address these and other questions by engaging students in substantial discussions on assigned repertory and readings.
