During the audition you play or sing a prepared piece for the conductor. Auditions for ensembles take place at the beginning of each academic year. Additional information regarding auditions, including downloadable excerpts for each instrument/voice, can be found here: http://www.music.ubc.ca/student-ensembles.html. Come in and sign up for audition times at the Music Office in late August or if you are unavailable to come in person, call our reception desk at 604-822-3113.",
