This course explores humankind\u0019s deep relationship with drumming and rhythmic play in South Korea, Ghana (West Africa), and England. Organized around the central concept of entrainment \u0014 the ability to perceive a beat and to synchronize to it \u0014 we will explore as a class the diverse and interrelated ways human cultures create rhythm and devise complex meanings from such activity in the areas of history, cosmology, social cohesion, and our relationship with the natural world. Class activities will be evenly split between lectures addressing historical, sociological, and music-theoretical concerns with lab-style workshops where students will learn to tap along and move to various rhythmic patterns. No previous musical experience or training and ~ is required.","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"328D","section_number":"001","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["HESSELINK, NATHAN"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"35","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Introduction to the principles of ethnomusicology and an examination of at least two contrasting musical traditions.
