Topics will include theories on the oral and written transmission of Gregorian chant, orality and literacy in secular song, pitch and rhythm in early polyphony, the format and function of music manuscripts, the role of notational innovations in composition, and the ways in which the rise of music printing related to practical music-making. Through these perspectives a wide variety of Medieval and Renaissance musical repertory will be explored in depth. Students taking this seminar will give regular in-class presentations based on reading/liste and ~ning assignments and will be expected to complete a research project culminating in a paper and final oral presentation.Prerequisite:  MUSC 120 or its equivalent, or permission of the instructor.","subject_code":"MUSC","course_number":"532T","section_number":"001","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["FISHER, ALEXANDER JOHN"],"totalRemaining":"3","currentlyRegistered":"7","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"3"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Research seminar on a core or emerging topic in music history or musicology.
