Permission to take 569 must come from the division coordinator (via a signed drop/add form forwarded to the MUSC student advisor) who will coach you in either 560 or 562, because 569  has 560 or 562 as a co-requisite (as 569 represents \"extra work\" you are doing in 560 or 562).  Not for use by pianists.",
