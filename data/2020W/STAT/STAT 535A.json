Course topics will include convex functions; KKT conditions and subdifferentials; implications for estimators; and first-order optimization algorithms. We will also discuss path algorithms and other tricks for penalized estimators.As a prerequisite, students should have taken Stat 560 and 561, as well as a graduate level course in Probability (Stat 547C)","subject_code":"STAT","course_number":"535A","section_number":"201","building":"Earth Sciences Building","room":"1042","instructors":["MCDONALD, DANIEL","MCDONALD, DANIEL(Coordinator)"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"20","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 1.5","description":" "}
