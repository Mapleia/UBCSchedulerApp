Students with previous experience in cancer research will benefit, however this is not a mandatory requirement.  Most of the students who take the course will be conducting their thesis research in some area of cancer biology, detection or treatment.Contact Cheryl Bishop at medical.genetics@ubc.ca to be placed on the wait list (please include your student #).Class offered on-line only for 2020W.Recommended textbook: \"Biology of Cancer\" by Robert Weinberg.",
