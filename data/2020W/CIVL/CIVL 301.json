Please check back regularly to see if space opens up in the class.  All applications requesting admission to the course will be considered in August.  Priority will be given to students requiring the course as a core component to their program and to Civil Engineering students requesting the course as a technical elective (if applicable).  You will be advised in August if you have been admitted to the class or not.",
