For more information please visit: http://www.asia.ubc.ca/undergraduate/department-wait-lists/ (Is the class blocked even though there are a few seats that are free? This is normal. Please check our website for what this means.)This course will familiarize you with modern Persian literature (in English translation) in Iran. You will also have a chance to conduct a small-scale, guided scholarly research project on the modern literature(s) of Iran, Afghanistan, and/or Tajikistan. The course is arranged thematically around readings from modern Persian literature in Iran from the mid-nineteenth to the twenty-first century. The readings include instances of representative short stories, novels, poems, plays, memoirs, and film adaptations. The themes include modernity; satire and self-ridicule; racialism; the West; diversity (gender, sexuality, class, etc.); the Iran-Iraq war; the environment; and the Iranian diaspora. While due to its limited scope, the course focuses on the case of modern Persian literature from Ir and ~an, for their major research projects, students are strongly encouraged and guided to conduct research on texts of their own choosing from the modern Persian or non-Persian (diasporic) literatures of Iran, Afghanistan, and/or Tajikistan.UBC has not yet confirmed an approach for Term 2 courses. The meeting days and times currently displayed reflect the maximum time that students will be expected to meet synchronously with the instructor. Should the decision be made to offer Term 2 courses online, one or more of these times may be dropped or reduced, and replaced with asynchronous learning tasks. These details will be updated here as they become available. The overall workload of the course will remain unchanged.",
