For more information please visit: http://www.asia.ubc.ca/undergraduate/department-wait-lists/ (Is the class blocked even though there are a few seats that are free? This is normal. Please check our website for what this means.)A solid background in Persian literature is useful for anyone who wants a better understanding of Asia and the Middle East. With the presumption that through literatures, we can visit cultures and times impossible for us to experience ourselves, this course will take you on a journey to get a taste of classical Persian literature and its various genres, themes, and imagery, in English translation, from the 10th century (when the New Persian language emerged) to the mid-19th century (when Persian literature experienced a paradigm shift later associated with Persian literary modernity). Having no prerequisites, the course provides you with the opportunity to read many instances of Persian literature created during the above period in Persia/the Greater Iran, that is, in regions that today  and ~would include the present-day Iran, Central Anatolia, and Central Asia; as well as in India. The course readings are organized chronologically, covering a variety of poets, authors, forms and themes. Though briefly, we will also discuss what is lost (and gained) in translation as well as how classical Persian literature has contributed to world literature. The course will include 2 lectures, group activities, and video screening. By the end of the course, the students will put together a Digital Anthology of Classical Persian Literature in English Translation.All course will be offered online in Term 1.  Instructors are currently adapting course content and determining the best delivery model for each course. Students can expect a variety of formats which may include a combination of online meetings and outside of class readings, recorded lecturers, and/or assignments, in various proportions. The meeting days and times currently displayed reflect the maximum time that students will be expected to meet synchronously with the instructor. One or more of these times may be dropped or reduced and replaced with asynchronous learning tasks. These details will updated here as they become available.",
