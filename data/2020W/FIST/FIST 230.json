As we examine specific contexts from which such cinemas are created, we also interrogate transnational connections in narrative, co-production, circulation, and cross-cultural and historical intimacies. Finally, we will learn and apply various theoretical and philosophical approaches with which to analyze films\u0019 form and content.",
