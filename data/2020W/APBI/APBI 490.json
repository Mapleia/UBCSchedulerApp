      "comments": "Agriculture was essential in the development of human civilization and continues to be essential for modern life. But as farming practices have changed to keep pace with the increased demands of a growing population, many of the practices of modern farming have become the subjects of intense public debate, including discussions about the relationship between agriculture and the environment, worker's rights, land-use, animal welfare, and human health. This course will introduce students to debates about the direction of agriculture at the policy level and provide them with the tools needed to effectively engage in these ongoing debates.  This course can be counted as a restricted elective for APBI majors (AABI, SAGE).  For more information, please contact the course instructor Adam Shrive and ~r   (adam.shriver@ubc.ca) or the UBC Wiki site (https://wiki.ubc.ca/Course:APBI490).  If you are interested in the course but do not meet the requirements for registration, please contact the course instructor. PLEASE NOTE portions of this course will run asynchronously; Wednesday classes will run synchronously.",
