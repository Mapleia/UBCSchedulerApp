The course aims to provide an understanding of the benefits and limitations of entomophagy from the perspective of health, environment and livelihood. The course will discuss the challenges encountered to develop insects as a new protein source for food and feed. The course will include insect rearing methods, preparation and processing of insects and incorporating them as an ingredient in food  and feed products. Aspects of entomophagy are explored through student reviews of recent research articles and presentations to the class.","subject_code":"APBI","course_number":"290","section_number":"001","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["AKHTAR, YASMIN"],"totalRemaining":"36","currentlyRegistered":"14","generalRemaining":"36","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Analysis and interpretation of current issues in applied biology.
