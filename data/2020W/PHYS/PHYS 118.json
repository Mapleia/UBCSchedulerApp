However students taking PHYS 118 who have previously taken PHYS 107 cannot take PHYS 119 (credit excluded) and should take PHYS 109 lab instead. Students intending to pursue any of the Physics and Astronomy specializations definitely require the PHYS 109 or PHYS 119 lab.Do NOT contact course instructor for registration help.
