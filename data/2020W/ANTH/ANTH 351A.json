      "comments": "ANTH 351: ETHNOGRAPHY OF MELANESIAMelanesian cultures have been front and centre in anthropological work for well over a century. Some of the most important theoretical ideas have emerged out of studies from this region. In addition, Melanesia is one of the earliest places where anthropologists have looked at such issues as anti-colonialism and resistance. In this course we will look at this region and its impact on anthropological thought. We will explore case studies which look at the nature of the colonial encounter, and post-colonial issues such as development and nationalism.",
