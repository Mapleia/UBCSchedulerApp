Although in this course we will focus most of our attention on communication technologies, we also ask what else can be included in the category of media. We perhaps all agree that newspapers, social media apps, billboards, talk shows, and music albums belong to the category of media. But how about sonograms and MRI images? Is the street not also a medium? Topics include media power and promotional culture, economy of attention, and social media-fueled movements.",
