This course introduces how we understand human ecology and environmental issues \u001cfrom the bottom up\u001d, in the context of rooted histories and living cultures. Looking at case studies of resource extraction, climate change, biodiversity conservation, agricultural adaptation, ecotourism and attempts to \u001cgreen\u001d the economy, we will explore how ethnographic methods support indigenous and local perspectives around the world, as people perceive, challenge and reshape the global processes and structural inequalities that affect them and their home places.",
