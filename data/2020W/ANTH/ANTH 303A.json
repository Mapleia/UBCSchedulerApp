Setting covid-19 against the historical backdrop of other pandemics, we ask what the virus can teach us about social inequality, political ideology and cultural adaptability.  Using ideas from the anthropology of science and medical anthropology, we also ask what mistakes scientists and pubic officials made and which public health measures (social distancing?  Masks?  Testing? Contact tracing?) proved most effective.   Readings will include works of journalism and fiction as well as academic articles.",

We use a variety of ethnographies and other supporting texts to learn about the region and its cultural, historical, and political complexity. We examine a wide range of historical and cultural accounts from across the region. In our discussions, we acquire critical tools for studying the region, including examining our discipline\u0019s contribution to the construction of the Middle East as a region in the first place.",
