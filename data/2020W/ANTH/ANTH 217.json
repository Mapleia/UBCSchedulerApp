Communication is key to both the maintenance of culture and cultural change. We explore the complex relationship between communication process and cultural practices to provide an understanding of culture necessary for studying communication, and vice-versa. Some discussions include: How does culture influence the communication process?; What is the relation between culture, communication, and identity?; Do we think differently because we use different languages to communicate?; How do various societal factors, including values, influence intercultural communication?",
