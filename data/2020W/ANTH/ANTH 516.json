This seminar offers a critical examination of qualitative methods framed by the anthropological approach of ethnography, including: interviewing, observation, oral and archival history, participatory research, material culture and collaboration. We will work from readings on methodology, from field accounts and case studies that look to the shifting ethnographic enterprise and to writing strategies, representation and issues raised by public scholarship.","subject_code":"ANTH","course_number":"516","section_number":"002","building":"Anthropology and Sociology","room":"134","instructors":["ROBERTSON, LESLIE"],"totalRemaining":"6","currentlyRegistered":"9","generalRemaining":"6","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"A discussion of selected methods used to observe, describe, and interpret cultural phenomena and social organization, including participant observation, interviewing, ethnographic semantics, life histories, componential analysis, and photography.
