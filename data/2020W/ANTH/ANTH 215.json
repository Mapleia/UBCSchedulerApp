We will look at present Japanese popular culture and also its historic past, revealing how the colourful all male Kabuki theatre and the Bunraku puppet/doll theatre, were once considered questionable indulgences in low-level activities by the ruling groups, but have since been relegated to embraced icons of Japanese tradition. We will discuss the interplay of popular sports considered older Japanese creations, such as sumo wrestling, with introduced Japanese sports, such as the embraced national pastime of baseball. We will discuss the touted Tokyo 2020 Olympics\u0014that wasn\u0019t, and whether this can really take place a year late in 2021 or  and ~be lost forever, and what the implications are for Japan.","subject_code":"ANTH","course_number":"215","section_number":"002","building":" ","room":"","instructors":["CREIGHTON, MILLIE","MENDOZA, SETH"],"totalRemaining":"24","currentlyRegistered":"76","generalRemaining":"24","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"Television shows, dramas, movies, advertising, marketing, manga (Japanese style \"comics\"), anime (Japanese animation), theatrical forms, popular literature, popular music, fashion fads, tourism, toys, and sports."}
