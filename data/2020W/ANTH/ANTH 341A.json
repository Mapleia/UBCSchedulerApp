      "comments": "ANTH 34A: Museums, Heritage  and  MemoryIn this course, we will examine the complex and contested relationships between tangible and intangible cultural heritage; between individual and collective memory practices; between the politics of remembering and the politics of forgetting, which are manifest in the production of space---landscapes, museums, and exhibitions. We will explore the ways in which museum-centred practices such as preservation, repatriation and display can be mobilized by individuals and groups to assert their identities and challenge dominant narratives or hegemonic practices. Our discussions will especially focus on contemporary heritage debates through a number of different local, Indigenous, regional, national and global contexts.",
