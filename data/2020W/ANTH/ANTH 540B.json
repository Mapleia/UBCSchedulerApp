While attending to theory, we read empirical studies about the power of refrigerators, the marriages of weapons scientists, how genes, cancer and depression are imagined, animal science, climate change, drug trials, and high-risk technologies.  Emphasis is on reading and discussion rather than lecture.","subject_code":"ANTH","course_number":"540B","section_number":"002","building":"Anthropology and Sociology","room":"134","instructors":["GUSTERSON, HUGH PHILLIMORE"],"totalRemaining":"4","currentlyRegistered":"11","generalRemaining":"4","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":" "}
