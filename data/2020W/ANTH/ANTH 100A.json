The things we tend to take for granted about modernity and progress, about gender and social roles, the \u001cnature\u001d of biology and environment, how the economy works, and the way we are meant to live with other people and species are all challenged by learning alternative ways of understanding, feeling, and \u001cbeing in the world\u001d. This class will introduce anthropological approaches based on cultural relativism. We will survey ethnographic case studies from various regions of the world to reflect critically upon histories of colonialism, ethnocentrism, power, resistance, and cultural resilience.","subject_code":"ANTH","course_number":"100A","section_number":"400","building":"Chemistry","room":"B250","instructors":["HEATHERINGTON,

Anthropology 100 Introduction to Cultural Anthropology (synopsis)This introductory course explores the central revelation of cultural anthropology; the idea that the social world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense, but rather is just one model of reality, the consequence of one set of intellectual and spiritual choices that our particular cultural lineage made, however successfully, many generations ago. The other peoples of the world are not failed attempts to be us, failed attempts to be modern. Each culture is a unique answer to a fundamental question. What does it mean to be human and alive? When asked that question humanity responds in 7000 different languages, voices that collectively comprise our repertoire for dealing with all the challenges that will confront us as a species in the coming centuries. Every culture has somet and ~hing to say, and each deserves to be heard.Change and technology pose no threat to culture, but power does. These are not delicate societies destined to fade away; they are living dynamic peoples being driven out of existence by identifiable forces. If human beings are the agents of cultural loss, we can surely be the facilitators of cultural survival.","subject_code":"ANTH","course_number":"100A","section_number":"003","building":"
