Is \u0018art\u0019 a useful category for anthropology to retain? What role can multisensory aesthetics play in decolonizing public spaces? How are ideas of personhood, cultural authenticity  and  cultural appropriation expressed in body decoration? These are some of the questions that we will be exploring in this course through a range of artforms  and  practices, from totem poles and tattoos, to street art, hip-hop aesthetics,  and  graphic novels.",
