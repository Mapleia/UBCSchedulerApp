The cultural data that anthropologists collect through ethnographic methods include practices and performances (e.g., online gaming), directly observable material objects (e.g., in-game chat scripts), and immaterial, invisible ideas and beliefs (e.g., the significance of friendship for online gamers). We will study major techniques, including participant-observation and interviewing, as we look at the process of ethnographic research from beginning to the end. This course also raises some of the issues ethnographers face: from the ethics of working with human subjects, to \u001crepresentation\u001d of others.","subject_code":"ANTH","course_number":"407","section_number":"001","building":"Mathematics","room":"203","instructors":["SHIVA, AMIRPOUYAN"],"totalRemaining":"10","currentlyRegistered":"30","generalRemaining":"10","restrictedRemaining":"0"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":"An examination of field work as the basic setting for ethnographic research.
