Are these values real, or just clich√©s?In this course, we will discuss the fundamental values that structure the Russian worldview, the historical events and societal pressures that went into forming it, and how these values are evident in the manifestations of Russian high culture we are all familiar with today.The class format is flexible. You can choose either a synchronous or asynchronous option. Students who choose the asynchronous option must participate by posting on the course discussion board. The course includes recorded lectures with slide illustrations, virtual synchronous seminars, online discussions, assigned readings from classic Russian literature, and films from celebrated Russian directors.",
