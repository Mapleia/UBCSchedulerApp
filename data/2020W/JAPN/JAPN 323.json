Please check our website for what this means.)UBC has not yet confirmed an approach for Term 2 courses. The meeting days and times currently displayed reflect the maximum time that students will be expected to meet synchronously with the instructor. Should the decision be made to offer Term 2 courses online, one or more of these times may be dropped or reduced and replaced with asynchronous learning tasks (similar to Term 1 sections). The overall workload of the course will remain unchanged. These details will be updated here as they become available.","subject_code":"JAPN","course_number":"323","section_number":"001","building":"Buchanan","room":"B306","instructors":["HOSHI, SAORI"],"totalRemaining":"0","currentlyRegistered":"24","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"0"},"W01":{"status":" ","section":"JAPN 323 W01","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=JAPN&course=323&section=W01&sessyr=2020&sesscd=W","activity":"Waiting List","term":"2","interval":"","days":" Mon Tue Thu Fri","start":"17:00","end":"18:00","comments":"-  Registering for this section does not mean you are enrolled in the course, this is a waitlist section.
