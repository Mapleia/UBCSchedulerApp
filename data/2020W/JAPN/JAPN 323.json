Please check our website for what this means.)This course will be delivered in a mix-mode format (3hrs synchronous + 1 hr asynchronous). Students are expected to meet with the instructor synchronously online for the sessions at the above listed days and times. In addition to the synchronous meetings, the remaining course materials will be delivered asynchronously, as outlined on the course syllabus, and students are expected to complete on their own time. The total workload for this 3-credit course remains the same as a normal class that is delivered in-person.",
