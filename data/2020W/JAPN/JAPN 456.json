For more information please visit: http://www.asia.ubc.ca/undergraduate/department-wait-lists/ (Is the class blocked even though there are a few seats that are free? This is normal. Please check our website for what this means.)This course will be delivered in a mix-mode format (1.5 hrs synchronous + 1.5 hrs asynchronous). Students are expected to meet with the instructor synchronously for the sessions at the above listed days and times. Besides the synchronous meetings, the rest of the teaching will be delivered asynchronously and students are expected to complete on their own time. The total workload for this 3-credit course remains the same as a normal class that is delivered in-person.",
