For more information please visit: http://www.asia.ubc.ca/undergraduate/department-wait-lists/ (Is the class blocked even though there are a few seats that are free? This is normal. Please check our website for what this means.)The focus of the course this semester will be on translation (Japanese -> English) and Japanese literary reading skills. It may be counted as a research intensive (R) course. - UBC has not yet confirmed an approach for Term 2 courses. The meeting days and times currently displayed reflect the maximum time that students will be expected to meet synchronously with the instructor. Should the decision be made to offer Term 2 courses online, one or more of these times may be dropped or reduced and replaced with asynchronous learning tasks (similar to Term 1 sections). The overall workload of the course will remain unchanged. These details will be updated here as they become available.",
