Please check our website for what this means.)UBC has not yet confirmed an approach for Term 2 courses. The meeting days and times currently displayed reflect the maximum time that students will be expected to meet synchronously with the instructor. Should the decision be made to offer Term 2 courses online, one or more of these times may be dropped or reduced and replaced with asynchronous learning tasks (similar to Term 1 sections).
