      "comments": "Educational psychology integrates both the theory of psychology and the practice of education.  This course will focus on understanding how people learn and grow, while considering items such as motivation, environmental influences and more. As we explore the different ways that people learn we will also consider what it means to learn, how to improve learning (both for ourselves and for others).   This course is open to all UBC undergraduate students who are interested in teaching in various contexts and learning about learning.  The registration restriction will be removed on July 23.",
