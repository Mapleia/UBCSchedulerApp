Concepts related to the matrix, imprint, index, mechanics of the medium, and multiplicity will be explored, and current theoretical texts discussed. Innovative traditional and non-traditional approaches to print media and printed matter may be explored. This includes the intersection of print with digital imaging, drawing, painting, book arts, sculpture, video, and performance and installation art.",
