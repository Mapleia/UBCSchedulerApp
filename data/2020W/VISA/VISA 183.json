Painting, mixed media, experimental practices and the role of the medium in creating and receiving images and how that has progressed through history within the boundaries of modern and post-modern tendencies in artistic practice. Focusing on colour, language, collage, and participatory work through strategies of reduction, deconstruction, abstraction and concept. Weekly one-hour lectures will be elaborated in three-hour studio times, applying learned concepts in class discussions, projects and homework; students are expected to show work for group critiques.",
