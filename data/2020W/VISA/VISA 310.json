Students will be periodically moved from the waitlist into the class as seats become available, and notified of their registration via email.This course covers historical, political, theoretical, and practical issues in art and image making in relation to digital interactive arts.  Contextualizing new media practice with art historical agendas to dissect the mediums influence over meaning, as well as creating pieces that directly deal with cyberspace and its potentials, you will be introduced to Adobe Flash, After Effects, and web-building applications to create digital works of art. A weekly three-hour seminar containing varying types of practice, from technical demos and lectures, class discussions, critiques, artist talks and class trips.",
