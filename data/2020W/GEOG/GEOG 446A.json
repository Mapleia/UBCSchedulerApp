The course examines the contemporary dynamics of global agro-food systems from a political ecology perspective in order to unpack the environmental, cultural, ethical, and socio-economic implications of our current food regime.  We will explore potential solutions to the global problems brought on by our current ago-food system, as well as take an indepth look at different grassroots responses to industrial food systems in the form of alternative food movements.",
