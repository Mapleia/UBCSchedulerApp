In the first half of the course, we will learn what it means to \"do\" feminist geography. In the second half, we will put this knowledge to work as we grapple with a range of topics - from the witchunts of the 16th century to 21st century markets in bodily commodities and many things in between.This online seminar has a synchronous scheduled meeting time.",
