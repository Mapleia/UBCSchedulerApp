      "comments": "This course is a Conservation Economics Course.Here is the course theme:  Members of a community have decided that they value a species, an ecosystem, waterway or grassland, or that their cultural or spiritual values are threatened by activities on a landscape. Ecologists have developed a model of the dynamics on this landscape and made recommendations. Now what? Conservation Economics develops the understanding of human behavior, trade-offs and incentives in problems related to environmental conservation. Using a problem-based approach to learning, we will use these tools to explore how members of a community can engage with the government and other local stakeholders to develop policies that incorporate the trade-offs involved in protecting species, ecosystem and landscape values.
